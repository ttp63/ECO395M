# Project  

I have posted a [set of project guidelines](https://github.com/jgscott/ECO395M/blob/master/exercises/project-guidelines.pdf) to give you some more specifics about how to prepare and submit your reports.  But the basic idea is what we've discussed before: find a problem and data set that interests you, approach it using the tools we've learned in class, and write a report.  


# How to prepare and submit your reports

For both HW and projects, you will be evaluated both on the technical correctness (50%) and the overall intellectual quality (50%) of your approach and write-up.  Strive to make each write-up self-contained and something that a future employer would find engaging and impressive.  Please try as far as possible to [follow the suggestions given here.](https://jgscott.github.io/teaching/writeups/write_ups/).  These guidelines are geared more towards the longer writeups for more complex data sets, but even for short problems, their general spirit should be followed.       

Prepare your reports using RMarkdown, so that they are fully reproducible, carefully integrating visual and numerical evidence with prose.  You may work solo, or in groups of 3 or fewer people.  If you're working in a group, please turn in a single submission with all of your names attached.

To submit, please e-mail Andrew at <ajlee@utexas.edu> with the subject line "ECO 395 Exercises N: name here" where N is the exercise number as appropriate (1, 2, etc.) And obviously use your own name in the subject, or the names of all your group members if applicable.

Your e-mail should have two links in it, one to a .md file and one to a .Rmd file:  
1) A link to a GitHub file where the final report has been created in Markdown (.md) format.  That means you should knit your RMarkdown file to a .md output.  PDF is acceptable if for whatever reason you can't get things to work with .md output, but definitely not HTML -- it doesn't render properly on GitHub.  
2) A link to the raw .Rmd file that can be used to reproduce your Markdown output from scratch.  

If you need to include mathematical expressions in your report, you can use Markdown's [math syntax](https://github.com/cben/mathdown/wiki/math-in-markdown).  Alternatively, you can just handwrite the math, snap a photo, and include the image in the final report.  This is a simple, low-overhead option.
